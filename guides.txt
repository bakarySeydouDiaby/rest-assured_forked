chatgpt : pull request in action

	Here is a step-by-step process to create a pull request on GitHub:

	- Fork the repository you want to contribute to. 
		This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account. 


	- Clone the forked repository to your local machine using Git.

	- Create a new branch in your local repository to make changes.

	- Make changes and commit them to the new branch.

	- Push the changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

	- On the GitHub website, navigate to the original repository and click on the "Compare & pull request" button.

	- Review the changes you have made and write a descriptive message explaining the purpose of the changes.

	- Submit the pull request and wait for the repository maintainer to review and merge the changes.

	Note: The exact steps may vary slightly depending on the repository, but this is the basic process for creating a pull request on GitHub.
